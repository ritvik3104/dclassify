### Built a convolutional neural network to predict doodles using Google's Quick Draw dataset, highly accurate.
### Processed and trained the model on a dataset of 300,000 images (100,000 per class) from three doodle categories: banana, basketball, and ladder.
### Created a user-friendly Flask web application where users can draw doodles and receive real-time predictions from the trained model.
